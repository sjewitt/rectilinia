# rectilinia

Inspired by One Monster (and my kids playing Mindecraft), a WAD with one monster type per map. The idea is to do a number of short maps, each with a single monster type and a puzzle to get out. I also want to keep it 'blocky', probably because both my kids are currently obsessed with Minecraft...
